1. Generate SSH Key (if not already generated)
If you don't already have an SSH key, generate one using the following command:

bash
Copy code
->>>> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
ed25519 is a modern, secure algorithm for SSH keys.
Replace your_email@example.com with your GitHub email.
Press Enter to save the key in the default location (~/.ssh/id_ed25519) and optionally set a passphrase.

2. Start SSH Agent
Start the SSH agent in the background:

bash
Copy code
->>>>>> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
3. Add SSH Private Key to the SSH Agent
Add your SSH private key to the agent:

bash
Copy code
->>>>>> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
4. Copy SSH Key to Clipboard
Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:

bash
Copy code
->>>>> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Manually copy the output.

5. Add SSH Key to GitHub
Go to GitHub and navigate to Settings > SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key.
Paste the SSH public key you copied earlier into the "Key" field.
Give the key a recognizable title and click Add SSH key.
6. Test SSH Connection
Test the SSH connection to GitHub to make sure it's working:

bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message like:

vbnet
Copy code
Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
7. Set the Remote to Use SSH
Navigate to your project directory and set the remote to use SSH:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
Replace USERNAME and REPO with your GitHub username and repository name.

8. Push to GitHub Using SSH
Push your local code to GitHub using the SSH remote:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
